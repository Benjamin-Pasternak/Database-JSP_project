# Database-JSP_project

# The code in this repository was for my databases class (336).
In this project, you are asked to implement a Bar-Beer-Drinker PLUS database
system. More specifically I used HTML and CSS for the client side, Java for the
server side, MySQL for the database server, and JDBC for connectivity between
my application and the database server.

We used an apache-tomcat server to host the the web application as well as a locally hosted MySQL server.

# Note
 More details are located within the project description.
 
 Tomcat-server not included in this repository however, I have included some doccumentation that specifies how to get it and install it.
 
 Additionally, I performed the individual assignment.
